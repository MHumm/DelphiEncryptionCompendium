*Import & Export Restrictions*

Please respect your own country's import and export restrictions regarding the use of strong cryptography, if applicable.

*License of DECMath*

  In previous versions (DEC Version 5.2 and older), DEC was split into 2 Parts: DEC Part I and DEC Part II, the latter also known as DECMath. For academical reasons excerpts of DEC Part II are kept in the Downloads sections. Those Parts had been developed for use with Delphi 5 to 7 and are available as pre-compiled DCUs only.

  DEC Part II is not available as freeware and it's distribution is only allowed for non-commercial or academical use. Please check back with the original author regarding any commercial use.

_*The SVN and releases after Version 5.2 do not include/need DECMath*_
