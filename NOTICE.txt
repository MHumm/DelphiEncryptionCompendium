Parts of the work loosely based on the works of Wolfgang Erhardt, who is
unfortunately dead already.

The SHA3 permutation kernel used is original copyright by Eric Grange and used 
with his permission. Most parts of the Base32 implementation are based on his 
as well with minor parts taken from the one of Darian Miller.
